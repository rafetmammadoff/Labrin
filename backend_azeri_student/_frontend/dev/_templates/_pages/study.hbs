            <p >The Australian continent is unique: pristine nature and rich fauna coexist with
                skyscrapers, business quarters and prestigious universities. The education
                system in Australia is built according to the British model. At the same time,
                the cost of training in Australian universities is significantly lower than in the
                US and European countries (30-40%). Universities of the country occupy high
                positions in international educational ratings. According to one of the most
                famous and respected editions of the Times Higher Education, the three largest
                Australian universities entered the first hundred of the World University
                Reputation Rankings for 2016.

          <h1>Prospects</h1>
          <p>Diplomas of Australian universities are highly valued all over the world. Universities with international affiliates
            take part in student exchange programs. In this country with a high standard of living, economic potential and the
            need for various specialists, a favorable migration policy operates. After completing the undergraduate program, a
            student can obtain a work visa for two years. A promising area is the hospitality industry, which is actively
            developing in Australia.
